# MegaNIST Dataset Generator

This program will generate MNIST dataset files using fonts provided, or (someday) from provided image files.

## FAQ
> Doesn't the MNIST dataset already exist?

Yes, but the url where it was originally located is no longer open to the public, and the version that can be downloaded from Kaggle only has 10,000 samples (for some reason).

> Does this use actual hand-written digits?

Not right now, but future versions might. This version cheats by using the font files on your computer to auto-generate the images of the digits.
